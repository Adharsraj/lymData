            How do I create a modern and sustainable website?

          <p className="mt-3">
            In order to achieve a modern web design, it is important that you
            understand your target group and their needs and adapt your web
            design accordingly. Use a responsive design that displays well on
            different devices and make navigation easy and intuitive. Also use
            the latest technologies and tools to ensure your web design is
            contemporary and up to date.

          <p className="mt-3">
            A strong connection to your target group is the basis for success in
            2023. As your digital home, accessible 24/7, your website not only
            serves the purpose of a digital business card, it is THE figurehead
            for you and/or your company.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-3">
            If you neglect your digital presence, you neglect your target
            groups, and thus your brand and reputation. It's easy for your
            competitor if you don't at least hold your ground.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-3">
            In order to be successful in the long term, it is essential that you
            invest in your web presence. Your customers will pay you back, I
