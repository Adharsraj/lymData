            HOW TO USE VIVA MAGENTA FOR YOUR DESIGN
          </h2>
          <h3 className="mt-6 text-lg">
            Viva Magenta is a bold color that can overwhelm your design if not
            used with care. But it also has the potential to add a pop of color
            to your images, deliver a bold message, or complement other design
            elements.
          </h3>

          <h3 className="mt-6 text-lg">
            The Pantone Color Institute chose Viva Magenta, among other things,
            to connect with and be inspired by nature. Not surprisingly, the
            proposed "Magentaverse" color palette includes several muted,
            natural colors like Pale Dogwood, Gray Sand, Fields of Rye, and
            Plein Air. In this particular palette, Viva Magenta is the most
            prominent color among the neutrals. But if muted grays and sandy
            browns aren't your thing, there are plenty of other ways to apply
            color theory and use viva magenta in your designs.
          </h3>

          <h3 className="mt-6 text-lg">
            Viva Magenta is a fascinating Pantone color of the year. Every year,
            the color of the year influences smartphone colors, fashion trends,
            web design and much more. Viva Magenta may or may not be the color
            that will shape the next generation. Anyway, why not give it a try
            and incorporate viva magenta into your designs? See how it stacks up
            with other colors and if it makes your designs even more colorful
            and interesting.
